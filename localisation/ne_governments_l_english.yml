 numenorian_throne_reform_desc:0 "Novelist scriptures tell of the legendary Charlemagne, an almost god-like figure who created the first kingdom of men. After establishing his kingdom, he founded a system of vassals and courts known today as feudalism to ensure his rule over the land. After the event, Charlemagne's followers (known as Novelists in modern times) emulated Charlemagne's institutions and brought feudalism into the new era.\nAfter the unification of Gondor due to the Sevillian crusades, Gondor entrenched itself in the most archaic and intense form of feudalism due to its reliance on vassal dukes and counts to defend its borders. Though it proved effective in halting the British and Iberian advance, Gondor's vassals are highly influential in the Gondorian court, with many of them acting as quasi-independent realms instead of vassals to Gondor."
